## Objective
Create a contact form that checks user inputs using JavaScript before submitting.

 ## Files Included
index.html – Contains the form structure
style.css – Styles the form for a clean layout
script.js – Handles input validation

## Features
Validates Name, Email, and Message
Shows error messages under each field
Uses regex to check email format
Prevents form submission if invalid
Shows a success message when all inputs are correct

## How to Run
Download all three files
Keep them in the same folder
Open index.html in your browser
Try submitting the form with empty or invalid inputs to test validation

## Validation Rules
Name: cannot be empty
Email: must match valid email format
Message: cannot be empty

## No Backend Needed

This form only uses client-side JavaScript, so nothing is sent to a server.
